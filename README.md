# Genetic Sequence Alignment Tool in MATLAB  
**Developer**: Parth Chopra  

This MATLAB-based GUI tool performs pairwise genetic sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch (Global) and Smith-Waterman (Local) algorithms. It supports input in FASTA format and visualizes the alignment process and results, making it suitable for bioinformatics research and educational purposes.

##  Features

-  User-friendly MATLAB GUI
-  FASTA file input support
-  Global (Needleman-Wunsch) & Local (Smith-Waterman) alignment
-  Dynamic programming matrix visualization
-  Alignment score display

---

##  Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Needleman-Wunsch (Global Alignment)
- Aligns entire sequences
- Useful for comparing sequences of similar length and composition

### 2. Smith-Waterman (Local Alignment)
- Aligns subsequences
- Ideal for finding conserved regions within larger sequences
